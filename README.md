Ticket Master is a secure, multi-threaded ticket booking system developed in Java, designed to handle high-traffic periods with data integrity and concurrency in mind. This system allows users to book tickets for events through a secure and reliable platform. The system ensures secure authentication, manages concurrent user requests, and maintains transactional integrity, making it ideal for handling large volumes of booking transactions simultaneously.

Implemented secure authentication mechanisms using hashed passwords and role-based access
control. Integrated a secure session management system to protect user data throughout their interaction
with the platform.
Developed a multi-threaded system to handle concurrent booking requests. Implemented synchronization
mechanisms and transaction management to ensure data integrity and prevent conflicts during
high-traffic periods
